# Waveshare ESP32-S3 Touch AMOLED 1.75C Arduino CLI

This workspace automates build, upload, and serial monitoring for the Waveshare ESP32-S3-Touch-AMOLED-1.75C using `arduino-cli`.

## Current Tested Baseline

- `arduino-cli` 1.5.1
- `esp32:esp32` core 3.3.5
- Port: `/dev/cu.usbmodem83101`
- Sketch: `sketches/codex_hello_world`
- Serial diagnostic sketch: `sketches/serial_probe`
- Visual OCR sketch: `sketches/display_ocr_check`
- Vendor examples/libraries: `/Users/phodal/Downloads/ESP32-S3-Touch-AMOLED-1.75C-main/examples/Arduino-v3.3.5`

The installed ESP32 core does not currently expose a dedicated `ESP32-S3-Touch-AMOLED-1.75C` FQBN. The scripts use `esp32:esp32:esp32s3` with explicit board options and the Waveshare 1.75C `pin_config.h`.

## Workflow Map

Use the Arduino lane first when validating local toolchain, display, touch, PMU, IMU, and audio examples. Use the XiaoZhi lane only when you intend to replace the currently flashed Arduino sketch with the XiaoZhi firmware or inspect that firmware route.

## Arduino Commands

```bash
make setup
make build
make upload
make monitor
make smoke
make visual-smoke
make camera-aligner
make official-demos
make official-build DEMO=01-helloworld
make official-smoke DEMO=01-helloworld
```

Override defaults with environment variables or `.env`:

```bash
ARDUINO_PORT=/dev/cu.usbmodem83101 make upload
WAVESHARE_VENDOR_DIR=/path/to/ESP32-S3-Touch-AMOLED-1.75C-main make build
```

`make smoke` builds with a dedicated build directory, uploads, then records a short serial log under `.logs/`.
On this macOS USB Serial/JTAG port, raw `stty` + `cat` captures data reliably; set `ARDUINO_CLI_MONITOR=1` to force `arduino-cli monitor`.

`make visual-smoke` uploads a static high-contrast OCR screen and then captures one camera frame with `ffmpeg` before checking it with macOS Vision OCR. Defaults:

```bash
CAMERA_DEVICE=0
CAMERA_SIZE=1280x720
CAMERA_CROP="iw*0.55:ih*0.65:(iw-ow)/2:(ih-oh)/2"
OCR_ROTATE=0
DISPLAY_ROTATION=0
OCR_EXPECTED="OK"
OCR_ENGINE=vision
```

Point the camera at the AMOLED before running the command. If macOS asks for camera permission, allow the terminal/Codex process and rerun.
If the board appears upside down in the camera, prefer `DISPLAY_ROTATION=2 make visual-smoke` so the sketch renders OCR text upright for the camera. Use `OCR_ROTATE` only when you cannot change the displayed orientation.

`make camera-aligner` opens a SwiftPM macOS camera tuning tool. Use it to:

- preview the selected camera live
- adjust the OCR crop rectangle with sliders
- set OCR rotation for boards that appear upside down in the camera
- see Vision OCR results update live
- copy the generated `CAMERA_CROP` and `OCR_ROTATE` values for `make visual-smoke`

`make official-demos` lists the Waveshare official Arduino examples tracked in `config/official-demos.tsv`.
Use `make official-build DEMO=<id>` for compile-only validation, and `make official-smoke DEMO=<id>` to upload a vendor demo and verify its expected serial output. Start with `DEMO=01-helloworld`, then move through PMU, IMU, LVGL, and audio demos.
See `docs/p0-official-demos.md` for the current P0 bring-up matrix and local verification notes.

## XiaoZhi AI Commands

```bash
make xiaozhi-latest
make xiaozhi-download
make xiaozhi-inspect
CONFIRM=--yes make xiaozhi-flash
make xiaozhi-source-clone
make xiaozhi-source-check
```

`make xiaozhi-latest`, `make xiaozhi-download`, and `make xiaozhi-inspect` automate the prebuilt XiaoZhi AI firmware route for `waveshare-esp32-s3-touch-amoled-1.75c`. `CONFIRM=--yes make xiaozhi-flash` writes the downloaded merged binary to the board and is intentionally explicit because it replaces the Arduino sketch currently on the device.

The source route uses `scripts/xiaozhi.sh idf-build`, `scripts/xiaozhi.sh idf-flash`, and `scripts/xiaozhi.sh idf-monitor` from an ESP-IDF shell where `idf.py` is available. See `docs/p0-xiaozhi-ai.md` for the current XiaoZhi acceptance notes.
