# Agent Notes

Recoding changes to the AGENTS.md file for better organization and clarity.

## Hardware Verification Practices

- Keep each hardware lane scriptable from `make`; interactive IDE state is not enough evidence.
- Keep `config/feature-matrix.tsv` current when adding or changing a feature lane, and run `make feature-matrix-check` before claiming coverage across the 12 requested directions.
- Use `make hardware-evidence-audit` before claiming completion across lanes; it exposes missing `Verified Locally` sections and missing smoke-suite evidence.
- Use `make goal-completion-audit` before claiming the full objective is done. It is stricter than evidence presence and keeps partial, external, conditional, and quiet-window lanes from being over-reported as complete.
- Prefer a narrow compile/upload/smoke loop before adding abstractions. For this board, clean Arduino CLI builds with dedicated `.arduino-build/<name>` paths avoid cache collisions.
- Serialize hardware uploads for the same USB Serial/JTAG port. Parallel `esptool` runs can fail with an exclusive lock on `/dev/cu.usbmodem83101`.
- Use `make hardware-smoke-list` and `make hardware-smoke-suite HARDWARE_SMOKE_ARGS="--target <id>"` for serialized multi-lane evidence. The default suite is non-audio and disables visual OCR unless `--with-visual` is passed.
- Official demos are `conditional` in the feature matrix. To collect suite evidence late at night, run only the default display/serial baseline with `make hardware-smoke-suite HARDWARE_SMOKE_ARGS="--target official-demos --allow-conditional"`; do not broaden that into ES7210/ES8311 audio demo checks.
- Use `make official-coverage` before claiming official demo coverage. It is read-only and shows which vendor examples have build artifacts, source presence, quiet audio marker readiness, and existing physical smoke logs.
- For official demos that print expected serial text only during `setup()`, use the Python stdlib `scripts/serial-capture.py` path so capture opens before RTS reset; do not flush serial input after reset or the first setup line can be lost.
- The official `03-power-axp2101` sketch waits indefinitely in Station Wi-Fi connection when its vendor credentials are not valid. The official runner applies a staged-only `OFFICIAL_POWER_WIFI_TIMEOUT_MS` patch for automation so AP, PMU, and LVGL setup can be physically smoked; treat that as PMU/LVGL evidence, not proof of Station Wi-Fi success.
- XiaoZhi is an audio product lane, but `xiaozhi-inspect`, `xiaozhi-preflight`, `xiaozhi-idf-env`, and `xiaozhi-idf-build` are non-destructive firmware/source readiness checks. They can run without `--allow-audio`; reserve `--allow-audio` for physical microphone/speaker smoke targets. Before any `xiaozhi-flash`, capture the `xiaozhi_preflight_summary` and `xiaozhi_idf_build_summary` lines so the firmware hash, serial port, esptool path, source marker, ESP-IDF status, and source-build artifacts are recorded.
- Official audio demos now have a quiet `make official-audio-preflight` gate. It compiles the ES7210/ES8311 vendor demos and checks source/serial markers, but it must not be treated as physical microphone/speaker evidence.
- Use `--skip-build` only when that lane's `.arduino-build/<name>` artifacts already exist; otherwise upload can fail because `*.partitions.bin` or related build outputs are missing.
- Treat serial output and camera OCR as complementary evidence: serial proves firmware control flow, while camera OCR proves the AMOLED actually renders expected text.
- Keep destructive actions explicit. Firmware replacement commands should require a visible confirmation variable or `--yes`.
- Stage vendor sketches instead of editing vendor sources when Arduino CLI requires folder and `.ino` names to match.
- Treat audible audio smokes as disruptive physical tests. Do not run speaker or microphone stimulus tests late at night unless the user explicitly asks for them.
- Prefer silent PMU/IMU/display validation when working late; serial metrics plus camera OCR can still produce strong evidence without using audio devices.
- Use `make audio-afe-readiness` or `make audio-vad-preflight` as the no-audio gate before scheduling `audio-vad-smoke`; they rebuild the ES7210 probe and check artifacts/checker wiring plus `config/audio-afe-profile.tsv` without playing stimulus, uploading firmware, or opening host audio devices.
- Treat `config/audio-afe-profile.tsv` as the audio-front-end contract: ES7210 capture and ESP-SR VAD are implemented, while AEC, noise suppression, and real WakeNet audio frames remain planned until source integration and physical audio evidence exist.

## Current Challenges

- The installed ESP32 Arduino core has no dedicated 1.75C FQBN, so the repo pins a generic ESP32-S3 FQBN with explicit flash/PSRAM/USB options.
- `arduino-cli monitor` can open but capture no bytes on the local USB Serial/JTAG port; raw `stty` plus `cat` is the reliable serial path.
- Camera OCR is sensitive to orientation, focus, glare, and pixel font shape. Use `make camera-aligner` and keep validation text large and simple.
- For AMOLED overexposure or color mismatch, first validate with `DISPLAY_BRIGHTNESS=96 OCR_PREPROCESS_MODE=color CAMERA_EXPOSURE_POINT=0.5,0.65 CAMERA_FOCUS_POINT=0.5,0.65 COLOR_SWATCH_CHECK=1 make visual-smoke`; the calibration sketch renders large `OK` text plus red/green/blue/yellow swatches, and the swatch checker reports per-color pixel counts and average RGB.
- Vision OCR can misread `AI OK` as `HI OK`; use serial to verify the full payload and OCR a stable subset such as `OK`.
- Camera capture has a `CAMERA_CAPTURE_TIMEOUT` guard. If ffmpeg times out before saving a frame, treat it as host camera availability/ownership first, not as board display failure.
- Use `make camera-diagnose` when OCR capture fails. It records system camera inventory, Swift AVFoundation device status, related camera processes, and video-only capture probes without touching audio input.
- `pyserial` is not installed in the current Python, so host relay tools should use stdlib `termios` or document their dependency explicitly.
- Python `audioop` is not available in the current Python, so WAV analysis should use explicit PCM byte parsing or a documented dependency.
- XiaoZhi source currently requires ESP-IDF `>=5.5.2`; the local automation defaults to `.vendor/esp-idf-v5.5.4` and `~/.espressif/python_env/idf5.5_py3.14_env`. If a login shell detects macOS Python 3.9 instead, use `make xiaozhi-idf-env` or `scripts/xiaozhi.sh idf-build` so the script exports the matching Python environment explicitly.
- PMU validation should not require a nonzero battery voltage because the battery connector may be unused; gate on system voltage and use battery voltage as supporting evidence.
- Power lifecycle validation should not require a connected battery by default. `power-lifecycle-smoke` uses serial-preserving DIM/STANDBY/ACTIVE states, so it proves firmware power-control behavior without claiming true ESP32 deep sleep or measured current draw.
- Wi-Fi validation should be scan-only by default. Do not hard-code or commit SSIDs/passwords; use `WIFI_TEST_SSID` and `WIFI_TEST_PASSWORD` only for supervised local join checks.
- Touch validation has two levels: default `touch-status-smoke` proves the CST9217 controller is online, while `TOUCH_REQUIRE_EVENT=1` requires a supervised human tap.

## Cloud AI Terminal Direction

- The first self-developed terminal slice uses serial relay control before direct audio streaming. This validates display rendering and host/cloud protocol shape without blocking on ASR/TTS integration.
- The Cloud AI terminal now has a non-audio ASR -> LLM -> TTS pipeline gate. Preserve `ASR:`, `LLM:`, `TTS:`, and `PIPELINE_DONE` when adding real ES7210/ES8311 streams so late-night validation can still prove protocol behavior without audio devices.
- The Cloud AI terminal has a verified non-audio control-plane gate. Preserve `SESSION:`, `CLOUD:REQ`, `CLOUD:ERR`, `METRICS?`, `CACHE:*`, and `STATE?` commands when adding network or audio paths so session/cloud/cache/state behavior remains testable without cloud credentials or audio devices.
- Move from mock/HTTP text responses to ES7210 microphone capture in small steps: first validate RMS/peak metrics, then require VAD speech, then stream audio for ASR.
- VAD is stricter than raw microphone capture. Treat RMS/peak threshold increases as the microphone data-flow gate, and use `AUDIO_VAD_REQUIRE_SPEECH=1` only when the host speaker is physically close enough.
- On the current desk setup, macOS `say` produced a clear ES7210 signal delta but did not trigger ESP-SR VAD; this is acceptable for the microphone data-flow gate but not for a wake-word or speech-command gate.
- ES8311 playback now has a board-generated tone probe and a host microphone gate. Treat the current gate as physical output evidence, not as proof of TTS quality or frequency accuracy.
- AXP2101 + QMI8658 now have a silent sensor-status probe. A stationary board should report accelerometer magnitude near 1 g; use the wider default range only as a smoke gate.
- The power lifecycle probe is the preferred P1 battery/low-power control gate. Keep its default path silent and serial-driven; only enable `POWER_REQUIRE_BATTERY=1` when a battery is physically connected.
- CST9217 touch now has a silent controller-online probe. Do not claim end-to-end touch UX without either the official LVGL widgets pass or a `TOUCH_REQUIRE_EVENT=1` manual tap pass.
- The LVGL visual-agent harness is the repo-owned proof for LVGL UI beyond vendor examples. Prefer it when validating chat/card/settings UI behavior; keep the official `05-lvgl-widgets` demo as the vendor baseline.
- The interaction dashboard is the preferred combined non-audio app smoke. It verifies display, touch-controller presence, PMU, and IMU through serial page switching plus optional OCR, without requiring a human tap or using any audio device.
- The interaction dashboard also has first-pass P1 behavior for IMU gestures and power management. Default automation uses serial-simulated gestures and power commands for determinism; real physical shake evidence should be reported separately as `DASH_GESTURE source=imu`.
- The IMU interaction probe is the dedicated P1 gate for wrist wake, shake-to-switch, posture menu, and step counting. Keep deterministic serial `SAMPLE:` vectors as the Skill-facing path; report live physical movement evidence separately when a human can move the board.
- The LVGL visual-agent harness is the preferred P1 touch UI / visual-agent slice. It uses real LVGL widgets and a serial protocol for chat bubbles, cards, settings, and agent thoughts, so UI behavior can be tested without network or audio dependencies.
- The desk widget is the first completed P1 desktop-widget slice. It is intentionally serial-driven before direct Wi-Fi integrations, and has a host relay that maps mock, JSON, or HTTP events into CI/GitHub/calendar/timer/LLM widget commands without credentials or audio devices.
- The IoT control panel is the first P1 Home Assistant/MQTT/HTTP slice. Its host relay maps mock, JSON, or HTTP smart-home events into the panel protocol, and Home Assistant events must use `IOT:HA` so the board emits `IOT_HA` plus a `ha=` state counter. Keep that board-visible event boundary before moving logic fully onto Wi-Fi firmware.
- The Wi-Fi connectivity probe is the network hardware gate for Cloud AI, desktop widget, and IoT work. Prefer it before debugging HTTP/MQTT application logic, and avoid logging nearby SSID names unless the user explicitly needs that evidence.
- The offline voice-control harness is a P1 non-audio gate for WakeNet/MultiNet behavior. Preserve the serial `WAKE:`, `CMD:`, `ADDCMD:`, `MODCMD:`, and `DELCMD:` simulation path when adding real ESP-SR audio so late-night validation can still prove the command state machine without microphone or speaker use.
- The TinyML IMU classifier now has a checked-in nearest-centroid model in `config/tinyml-imu-model.json`. Run `make tinyml-imu-model-check` before board smoke, and keep deterministic serial `SAMPLE:` vectors as the Skill-facing acceptance path even after replacing the embedded model with ESP-DL or a larger trained model.
- The ESP-Claw/OpenClaw agent harness is a P2 compatibility path, not the official ESP-Claw firmware. Preserve the serial `LUA:LOAD`, `RULE:ADD`, `MCP:REGISTER`, `MCP:CALL`, `MEM:PUT`, `MEM:GET`, and `EVENT` gates so Skill automation can prove sense/reason/decide/act behavior without IM credentials, Wi-Fi, camera, or audio.

## Feature Push README Hook

- This repo uses `.githooks/pre-push`; install it with `make install-hooks` or `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`.
- When an outgoing push ref or commit subject includes `feat`, the hook must update the generated `README.md` section between `<!-- feat-push-readme:start -->` and `<!-- feat-push-readme:end -->`.
- Because a pre-push hook cannot add a newly modified `README.md` to the already prepared push, the hook intentionally stops that push after updating the file. Commit the README change, then push again.
- AI agents changing feature behavior should keep `README.md` current before committing, and should not remove the generated marker block unless they also replace the hook behavior.
