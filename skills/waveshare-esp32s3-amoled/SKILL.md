# Waveshare ESP32-S3 AMOLED

## Overview

Use this skill to bring up Waveshare ESP32-S3 Touch AMOLED Arduino projects through `arduino-cli`, with reproducible CLI setup, vendor library handling, compile/upload commands, and serial validation.

## Default Workflow

1. Inspect the hardware and local state:
   - Run `arduino-cli version`, `arduino-cli core list`, and `arduino-cli board list`.
   - Prefer `/dev/cu.usbmodem*` on macOS; the known local port has been `/dev/cu.usbmodem83101`.
   - Search installed boards with `arduino-cli board listall | rg -i 'waveshare|amoled|esp32.?s3|touch'`.

2. Align versions before debugging code:
   - Use `esp32:esp32@3.3.5` for Waveshare `examples/Arduino-v3.3.5`.
   - If `esp32:esp32@3.3.10` is installed, expect the bundled GFX v1.6.4 library to fail around `spiFrequencyToClockDiv`; install 3.3.5 instead.
   - Add the Espressif package URL if missing: `https://espressif.github.io/arduino-esp32/package_esp32_index.json`.

3. Use the correct build surface:
   - Vendor repo: `waveshareteam/ESP32-S3-Touch-AMOLED-1.75C`.
   - Arduino examples/libraries: `examples/Arduino-v3.3.5`.
   - The current Espressif core exposes Waveshare AMOLED 1.43/1.64/1.8/1.91/etc., but not a dedicated 1.75C FQBN. For 1.75C, use generic `esp32:esp32:esp32s3` plus explicit options and the 1.75C `pin_config.h`.

4. Compile serially:
   - Do not run concurrent `arduino-cli compile` jobs into the same cache/build path.
   - Use `--jobs 1`, `--clean`, and a dedicated `--build-path` for reliable validation.

5. Upload and validate:
   - Upload to the detected `/dev/cu.usbmodem*` port.
   - On macOS, prefer raw serial capture with `stty -f "$PORT" 115200 cs8 -cstopb -parenb -ixon -ixoff -echo` followed by `cat "$PORT"`.
   - Use `arduino-cli monitor --config baudrate=115200,dtr=on,rts=off` only as a fallback; it may open successfully but capture no bytes on this USB Serial/JTAG path.
   - Treat repeated sketch serial lines plus visible AMOLED output as the baseline pass condition.

6. For visual display validation:
   - Upload `sketches/display_ocr_check` when the project has it.
   - If OCR framing or orientation is uncertain, run `make camera-aligner` first. Copy the generated `CAMERA_CROP='...' OCR_ROTATE=...` environment values.
   - If the board appears upside down in the camera, prefer `DISPLAY_ROTATION=2 make visual-smoke` so the sketch renders upright text for OCR.
   - Run `CAMERA_CROP='...' OCR_ROTATE=... DISPLAY_ROTATION=... make visual-smoke` to capture one camera frame with `ffmpeg` and OCR it with macOS Vision.
   - Camera capture is bounded by `CAMERA_CAPTURE_TIMEOUT`; if it times out before saving a frame, debug macOS camera availability or another app owning the camera before changing board firmware.
   - Run `make camera-diagnose` when capture fails; it records camera inventory, Swift AVFoundation status, related processes, and bounded video-only capture probes under `.logs/`.
   - Pass only if OCR sees `OK`; use the saved raw/processed images to debug focus, glare, rotation, or garbled output.

7. For official demo bring-up:
   - Run `make official-demos` to list the Waveshare Arduino demo manifest.
   - Run `make official-build-all` before debugging higher-level AI features; all official Arduino examples should compile first.
   - Run `SMOKE_SECONDS=8 make official-smoke DEMO=01-helloworld` to upload the official display baseline and verify runtime serial output.
   - The project runner stages vendor examples under `.arduino-build/official-sketches/<id>` because several official `.ino` filenames do not match their parent folder names, which `arduino-cli` requires.

8. For feature coverage auditing:
   - Run `make feature-matrix-check` to verify all 12 requested feature directions have matching Makefile targets, scripts/sketches, docs, and Skill helper wiring.
   - Run `make feature-matrix-doc` after changing `config/feature-matrix.tsv` to regenerate `docs/hardware-verification-matrix.md`.
   - Run `make hardware-evidence-audit` to identify lanes with missing `Verified Locally` sections or missing smoke-suite evidence.
   - Run `make hardware-evidence-doc` to regenerate `docs/hardware-evidence-audit.md`.
   - Run `make goal-completion-audit` for the stricter requirement-level completion gate; use `python3 scripts/goal-completion-audit.py --strict` only when a non-zero result should fail CI or handoff.
   - Run `make goal-completion-doc` to regenerate `docs/goal-completion-audit.md`.
   - Run `make hardware-smoke-list` to inspect the default serialized non-audio smoke selection.
   - Run `make hardware-smoke-suite HARDWARE_SMOKE_ARGS="--target <id>"` for a narrow serialized hardware lane; the default suite skips audio, conditional, and external lanes.
   - Run `make hardware-smoke-suite HARDWARE_SMOKE_ARGS="--target xiaozhi-ai --allow-external"` for the non-destructive XiaoZhi firmware archive check; it does not flash firmware or use audio hardware.
   - Treat matrix status values as coverage metadata, not proof that a partial or external feature is complete.

9. For XiaoZhi AI bring-up:
   - Run `make xiaozhi-latest` to locate the latest official `waveshare-esp32-s3-touch-amoled-1.75c` release asset.
   - Run `make xiaozhi-inspect` before flashing; it should confirm the zip contains `merged-binary.bin`.
   - Run `make xiaozhi-flash` only when the user is ready to replace the current Arduino demo with XiaoZhi firmware.
   - For source builds, run `make xiaozhi-source-clone` then `make xiaozhi-source-check`; the local defaults select `CONFIG_BOARD_TYPE_WAVESHARE_ESP32_S3_TOUCH_AMOLED_1_75C=y`.
   - If `idf.py` is missing, stop at source-check and tell the user to install/source ESP-IDF before `scripts/xiaozhi.sh idf-build`.

10. For the self-developed cloud AI terminal:
   - Run `make cloud-ai-build` to compile the board-side display/serial terminal.
   - Run `make cloud-ai-smoke` to upload it and verify the host serial relay reaches `AI_DISPLAYED`.
   - Run `make cloud-ai-pipeline-smoke` to upload it and verify the silent ASR -> LLM -> TTS serial pipeline reaches `PIPELINE_DONE`.
   - Run `make cloud-ai-cache-smoke` to upload it and verify board-local NVS cache plus `STATE?` runtime status commands.
   - Run `CLOUD_AI_VISUAL_SMOKE=1 DISPLAY_ROTATION=2 make cloud-ai-smoke` when the camera is positioned for OCR; serial verifies `AI OK`, while OCR should at least see stable `OK`.
   - Treat this as the control-plane slice; pipeline smoke does not use microphone or speaker hardware. ES7210 microphone input and ES8311 speaker output still need dedicated audio stream validation.

11. For microphone/audio-front-end validation:
   - Run `make audio-vad-build` to compile the ES7210 microphone probe.
   - Run `make audio-vad-preflight` when audio should stay quiet; it rebuilds and checks artifacts, serial port, ES7210 source markers, and checker options without uploading, playing stimulus, or opening audio devices.
   - Run `make audio-vad-smoke` to upload it, play a host-side `say` stimulus, and validate RMS/peak serial metrics.
   - Use `AUDIO_VAD_REQUIRE_SPEECH=1 make audio-vad-smoke` only when the host speaker is close enough for reliable VAD.
   - Use `AUDIO_VAD_VISUAL_SMOKE=1 DISPLAY_ROTATION=2 make audio-vad-smoke` when camera OCR should verify the screen reaches `OK`.

12. For speaker/audio-output validation:
   - Run `make speaker-output-build` to compile the ES8311 speaker tone probe.
   - Run `make speaker-output-smoke` to upload it, trigger a 1 kHz / 1.5 kHz tone over serial, and validate the output through host microphone capture.
   - Use `SPEAKER_AUDIO_DEVICE=<avfoundation audio index>` when the default camera microphone is not close to the board speaker.
   - Use `SPEAKER_VISUAL_SMOKE=1 DISPLAY_ROTATION=2 make speaker-output-smoke` when camera OCR should verify the screen reaches `OK`.
   - Do not run audible speaker or microphone smoke tests late at night unless the user explicitly asks for them.

13. For PMU/IMU sensor validation:
   - Run `make sensor-status-build` to compile the AXP2101 + QMI8658 status probe.
   - Run `make sensor-status-smoke` to upload it and validate silent serial metrics from the PMU and IMU.
   - Use `SENSOR_STATUS_VISUAL_SMOKE=1 DISPLAY_ROTATION=2 make sensor-status-smoke` when camera OCR should verify the screen reaches `OK`.
   - This path is safe for late-night validation because it does not play audio or use the host microphone.

14. For battery and low-power lifecycle validation:
   - Run `make power-lifecycle-build` to compile the AXP2101 power lifecycle probe.
   - Run `make power-lifecycle-smoke` to upload it and validate DIM, STANDBY, ACTIVE, brightness, capacity, load-profile, wake, and runtime-estimate serial behavior.
   - Use `POWER_REQUIRE_BATTERY=1 make power-lifecycle-smoke` only when a battery is physically connected; the default smoke should not fail USB-only benches.
   - Use `POWER_LIFECYCLE_VISUAL_SMOKE=1 DISPLAY_ROTATION=2 make power-lifecycle-smoke` when camera OCR should verify the screen reaches `OK`.
   - This path is safe for late-night validation because it does not play audio or use the host microphone. Its standby mode keeps serial alive and should not be treated as proof of true ESP32 deep sleep or measured current draw.

15. For Wi-Fi connectivity validation:
   - Run `make wifi-connectivity-build` to compile the ESP32-S3 Wi-Fi scan/join probe.
   - Run `make wifi-connectivity-smoke` to upload it and validate Wi-Fi radio initialization plus scan completion without storing credentials.
   - Use `WIFI_TEST_SSID=... WIFI_TEST_PASSWORD=... make wifi-connectivity-smoke` only for a supervised join check; never commit SSIDs or passwords.
   - Use `WIFI_CONNECTIVITY_VISUAL_SMOKE=1 DISPLAY_ROTATION=2 make wifi-connectivity-smoke` when camera OCR should verify the screen reaches `OK`.
   - This path is safe for late-night validation because it does not play audio or use the host microphone. The default serial log avoids printing SSID names.

16. For touch controller validation:
   - Run `make touch-status-build` to compile the CST92xx touch controller probe.
   - Run `make touch-status-smoke` to upload it and validate the touch controller is online through serial status and AMOLED OCR.
   - Use `TOUCH_REQUIRE_EVENT=1 make touch-status-smoke` only when a human can touch the screen during the smoke window.
   - Use `TOUCH_STATUS_VISUAL_SMOKE=1 DISPLAY_ROTATION=2 make touch-status-smoke` when camera OCR should verify the screen reaches `OK`.

17. For combined non-audio app validation:
   - Run `make interaction-dashboard-build` to compile the combined display, touch-controller, PMU, and IMU dashboard.
   - Run `make interaction-dashboard-smoke` to upload it and drive page changes, serial-simulated IMU gesture handling, brightness, standby, and wake transitions without requiring a human tap.
   - Use `INTERACTION_DASHBOARD_VISUAL_SMOKE=1 DISPLAY_ROTATION=2 make interaction-dashboard-smoke` when camera OCR should verify the final dashboard page reaches `OK`.
   - This path is safe for late-night validation because it does not play audio or use the host microphone.

18. For dedicated IMU interaction validation:
   - Run `make imu-interaction-build` to compile the QMI8658 wrist wake, shake switch, posture menu, and step counter probe.
   - Run `make imu-interaction-smoke` to upload it and validate deterministic serial-injected IMU samples for `WRIST_WAKE`, `SHAKE_SWITCH`, `POSE_MENU`, `STEP`, and `MENU_NEXT`.
   - Use `IMU_INTERACTION_VISUAL_SMOKE=1 DISPLAY_ROTATION=2 make imu-interaction-smoke` when camera OCR should verify the screen reaches `OK`.
   - This path is safe for late-night validation because it does not play audio, use the host microphone, or require physically shaking the board.

19. For LVGL visual-agent validation:
   - Run `make lvgl-visual-agent-build` to compile the repo-owned LVGL tabview app.
   - Run `make lvgl-visual-agent-smoke` to upload it and validate LVGL initialization, display flush, CST92xx touch input registration, chat bubbles, cards, settings, agent thoughts, and tab/page changes over serial.
   - Use `LVGL_VISUAL_AGENT_VISUAL_SMOKE=1 DISPLAY_ROTATION=2 make lvgl-visual-agent-smoke` when camera OCR should verify the screen reaches `OK`.
   - Treat this as the agent-specific LVGL UI slice; the official `05-lvgl-widgets` demo remains the vendor baseline.
   - This path is safe for late-night validation because it does not play audio or use the host microphone.

20. For desktop AI widget validation:
   - Run `make desk-widget-build` to compile the serial-driven desktop widget.
   - Run `make desk-widget-smoke` to upload it and validate CI/GitHub/alert/calendar/timer/AI-summary pages without network credentials.
   - Run `make desk-widget-relay-smoke` to validate the host event adapter that maps mock, JSON, or HTTP events into the widget serial protocol.
   - Use `DESK_WIDGET_VISUAL_SMOKE=1 DISPLAY_ROTATION=2 make desk-widget-smoke` when camera OCR should verify the screen reaches `OK`.
   - This path is safe for late-night validation because it does not play audio or use the host microphone.

21. For IoT control panel validation:
   - Run `make iot-panel-build` to compile the serial-driven Home Assistant / MQTT / HTTP control panel.
   - Run `make iot-panel-smoke` to upload it and validate device state changes, explicit `IOT_HA` Home Assistant service calls, MQTT-style inbound updates, HTTP-style outbound actions, and scenes without Wi-Fi credentials.
   - Run `make iot-panel-relay-smoke` to validate the host event adapter that maps mock, JSON, or HTTP smart-home events into the panel serial protocol, including board-side `IOT_HA` output and the `ha=` state counter.
   - Use `IOT_PANEL_VISUAL_SMOKE=1 DISPLAY_ROTATION=2 make iot-panel-smoke` when camera OCR should verify the screen reaches `OK`.
   - This path is safe for late-night validation because it does not play audio or use the host microphone.

22. For offline voice-control state-machine validation:
   - Run `make offline-voice-build` to compile the WakeNet/MultiNet-facing serial harness.
   - Run `make offline-voice-smoke` to upload it and validate pre-wake command rejection, wake events, command recognition, runtime command add, continuous mode, sleep/wake state, and local actions without using the microphone.
   - Use `OFFLINE_VOICE_VISUAL_SMOKE=1 DISPLAY_ROTATION=2 make offline-voice-smoke` when camera OCR should verify the screen reaches `OK`.
   - Treat this as the deterministic control-plane gate before wiring real ESP-SR audio frames and models.
   - This path is safe for late-night validation because it does not play audio or use the host microphone.

23. For TinyML / IMU classifier validation:
   - Run `make tinyml-imu-build` to compile the QMI8658 TinyML classifier scaffold.
   - Run `make tinyml-imu-smoke` to upload it, disable live IMU mode, inject deterministic serial feature vectors, and verify `REST`, `TILT_LEFT`, `TILT_RIGHT`, and `SHAKE` labels.
   - Use `TINYML_IMU_VISUAL_SMOKE=1 DISPLAY_ROTATION=2 make tinyml-imu-smoke` when camera OCR should verify the screen reaches `OK`.
   - Treat this as a TinyML automation harness. The current embedded classifier is intentionally simple and should be replaced by ESP-DL or a trained model later without removing the deterministic serial sample gate.
   - This path is safe for late-night validation because it does not play audio or use the host microphone.

24. For ESP-Claw / OpenClaw agent harness validation:
   - Run `make esp-claw-agent-build` to compile the Arduino compatibility harness for the ESP-Claw/OpenClaw direction.
   - Run `make esp-claw-agent-smoke` to upload it and validate local rule add, event sensing, rule decision, MCP-style tool invocation, IM chat input, tagged memory, and LLM fallback routing over serial.
   - Use `ESP_CLAW_AGENT_VISUAL_SMOKE=1 DISPLAY_ROTATION=2 make esp-claw-agent-smoke` when camera OCR should verify the screen reaches `OK`.
   - Treat this as a deterministic control-plane harness, not the official ESP-Claw firmware image. It exists so automation can prove the agent loop before IM credentials, Wi-Fi, and full ESP-Claw source builds are introduced.
   - This path is safe for late-night validation because it does not play audio or use the host microphone.

25. For Skill automation wiring:
   - Run `scripts/waveshare-arduino-cli.sh verify <project-dir>` from this skill to prove the agent-facing entrypoint can inspect the toolchain, see the USB board, list official demos, and clean-compile `cloud_ai_terminal`, `audio_vad_probe`, `speaker_output_probe`, `sensor_status_probe`, `power_lifecycle_probe`, `wifi_connectivity_probe`, `touch_status_probe`, `interaction_dashboard`, `imu_interaction_probe`, `lvgl_visual_agent`, `desk_widget`, `iot_control_panel`, `offline_voice_control`, `tinyml_imu_classifier`, and `esp_claw_agent`.
   - Run `scripts/waveshare-arduino-cli.sh feature-matrix <project-dir> check` to validate coverage metadata before claiming all 12 requested directions are wired.
   - `verify`/`doctor` is intentionally compile-only; it does not upload firmware or run camera OCR.
   - Run explicit hardware smokes when the user wants board validation:
     `CLOUD_AI_VISUAL_SMOKE=1 DISPLAY_ROTATION=2 scripts/waveshare-arduino-cli.sh cloud-ai <project-dir> smoke`
     `CLOUD_AI_VISUAL_SMOKE=1 DISPLAY_ROTATION=2 scripts/waveshare-arduino-cli.sh cloud-ai <project-dir> pipeline`
     `scripts/waveshare-arduino-cli.sh cloud-ai <project-dir> cache`
     `AUDIO_VAD_VISUAL_SMOKE=1 DISPLAY_ROTATION=2 scripts/waveshare-arduino-cli.sh audio-vad <project-dir> smoke`
     `SPEAKER_VISUAL_SMOKE=1 DISPLAY_ROTATION=2 scripts/waveshare-arduino-cli.sh speaker-output <project-dir> smoke`
     `SENSOR_STATUS_VISUAL_SMOKE=1 DISPLAY_ROTATION=2 scripts/waveshare-arduino-cli.sh sensor-status <project-dir> smoke`
     `POWER_LIFECYCLE_VISUAL_SMOKE=1 DISPLAY_ROTATION=2 scripts/waveshare-arduino-cli.sh power-lifecycle <project-dir> smoke`
     `WIFI_CONNECTIVITY_VISUAL_SMOKE=1 DISPLAY_ROTATION=2 scripts/waveshare-arduino-cli.sh wifi-connectivity <project-dir> smoke`
     `TOUCH_STATUS_VISUAL_SMOKE=1 DISPLAY_ROTATION=2 scripts/waveshare-arduino-cli.sh touch-status <project-dir> smoke`
     `INTERACTION_DASHBOARD_VISUAL_SMOKE=1 DISPLAY_ROTATION=2 scripts/waveshare-arduino-cli.sh interaction-dashboard <project-dir> smoke`
     `IMU_INTERACTION_VISUAL_SMOKE=1 DISPLAY_ROTATION=2 scripts/waveshare-arduino-cli.sh imu-interaction <project-dir> smoke`
     `LVGL_VISUAL_AGENT_VISUAL_SMOKE=1 DISPLAY_ROTATION=2 scripts/waveshare-arduino-cli.sh lvgl-visual-agent <project-dir> smoke`
     `DESK_WIDGET_VISUAL_SMOKE=1 DISPLAY_ROTATION=2 scripts/waveshare-arduino-cli.sh desk-widget <project-dir> smoke`
     `scripts/waveshare-arduino-cli.sh desk-widget <project-dir> relay`
     `IOT_PANEL_VISUAL_SMOKE=1 DISPLAY_ROTATION=2 scripts/waveshare-arduino-cli.sh iot-panel <project-dir> smoke`
     `scripts/waveshare-arduino-cli.sh iot-panel <project-dir> relay`
     `OFFLINE_VOICE_VISUAL_SMOKE=1 DISPLAY_ROTATION=2 scripts/waveshare-arduino-cli.sh offline-voice <project-dir> smoke`
     `TINYML_IMU_VISUAL_SMOKE=1 DISPLAY_ROTATION=2 scripts/waveshare-arduino-cli.sh tinyml-imu <project-dir> smoke`
     and
     `ESP_CLAW_AGENT_VISUAL_SMOKE=1 DISPLAY_ROTATION=2 scripts/waveshare-arduino-cli.sh esp-claw-agent <project-dir> smoke`.

## Known 1.75C FQBN

Use this FQBN unless a future Espressif core adds a real 1.75C board profile:

```text
esp32:esp32:esp32s3:USBMode=hwcdc,UploadMode=default,CDCOnBoot=cdc,CPUFreq=240,FlashMode=qio,FlashSize=16M,PartitionScheme=app3M_fat9M_16MB,PSRAM=opi,UploadSpeed=921600
```

If upload fails, retry with `UploadSpeed=460800` before changing board families.

## Helper Script

Use `scripts/waveshare-arduino-cli.sh` from this skill for a portable setup/build/upload/monitor wrapper when the target project does not already provide scripts.

Example:

```bash
/Users/phodal/.codex/skills/waveshare-esp32s3-amoled/scripts/waveshare-arduino-cli.sh setup /path/to/project
/Users/phodal/.codex/skills/waveshare-esp32s3-amoled/scripts/waveshare-arduino-cli.sh build /path/to/project
/Users/phodal/.codex/skills/waveshare-esp32s3-amoled/scripts/waveshare-arduino-cli.sh upload /path/to/project
```

If the project contains `scripts/setup.sh`, `scripts/build.sh`, `scripts/upload.sh`, or `scripts/monitor.sh`, prefer those project scripts because they encode project-local sketch paths.
